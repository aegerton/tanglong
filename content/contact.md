## ANTHONY EGERTON
Anthony (Tony) Egerton (<tony@tanglong.com.sg>) has over 30 years’ experience in finance and insurance. He started his career working as a broker of major oil company programmes in the London insurance market. He has been an underwriter in the alternative risk transfer (‘ART’) sector and, after heading up the Lloyd’s specialist insurance market in Asia, was, until recently, responsible for building a very successful regional affinity practice for Jardine Lloyd Thompson Asia.

His extensive knowledge of the region stretches back to 1998 when he first moved to Hong Kong to establish a new Asian underwriting operation for Centre Solutions - Zurich Group’s finite risk and structured finance subsidiary. In 2003, Tony became President, Asia-Pacific for Lloyd’s, a post he held for five years, with regional responsibility for the franchise’s development strategy. He oversaw the dramatic expansion of Lloyd’s Asia from two to 15 syndicates (annual premium US$140million - MAS Insurance Statistics 2007), an achievement recognised by the Singapore British Chamber of Commerce in 2007 with the Award for Financial & Professional Services. 

Tony has a Master’s Degree in Economics from Cambridge University, holds a MBA from the London Business School and is an Associate of the Chartered Insurance Institute. A Director and Shareholder of several SMEs in the region, he is also a Certified Executive Coach.  He has been appointed to the Labuan IBFC's Panel of International Specialists since 2015.
