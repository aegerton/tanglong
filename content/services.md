Our mission is to provide solutions to problems that no one else can. Our passion and knowledge is your resource to achieve modern economic success as a high performance business.

***Data*** - Is it the 'new oil'?  Making the correct business decision depends upon a timely and accurate assessment of all available sources of information.  Today's world is awash with a huge variety of such sources, but the key is to 'wrangle', analyse and visualise them sufficiently to the point where the fundamental themes emerge.  The appropriate application of Data Science requires a delicate balance between technical programming skills and in-depth domain knowledge.  Open source programming languages are an essential ingredient in achieving the right mix.

***Ideas*** – good ideas are scarce, even in the most innovative of businesses. We help our clients generate and implement truly creative, valuable solutions. Our solutions are the result of a thorough analysis of our clients’ products and services. Our business changing ideas will address issues such as value design, strategy, management, motivation and opportunities for new business product lines and thinking. TLC invests in critical research that provides us with unique insights into long term trends and cycles. To predict the future is to be prepared.

***People*** - finding the right people is key for any business, both in terms of their knowledge and experience, but also in their ability and willingness to work as part of the broader team. Genuine peer respect and co-operation is an essential ingredient in any successful team and needs to be nurtured and supported.

***Connections*** – on entering or exiting any market accessing the right relationships, whilst upholding the values of honesty and integrity, is invaluable. Our network of contacts across the region’s corporations and institutions is pre-eminent and at the disposal of our clients. 

***Money*** – having sufficient capital is vital to ensure that opportunities can be exploited fully and valuation maximised, whether it be in the form of equity, debt or structured finance.  The Asian private equity market has rebounded more robustly than its Western peers.  We have seen a fundamental shift Eastwards since 2007, when Asia accounted for only 10% of global private equity deal-making. Last year, Asia’s share was almost 17% and, with Asia proving more resilient to the current volatility, the region is now the priority for many global firms.
