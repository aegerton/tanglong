## LOCALISED EXPERIENCE
TLC's Principals established a highly successful structured finance operation in Hong Kong in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis. Through practical experience, we understand the challenges of growing a business under difficult market conditions and place strong emphasis on ensuring that our clients secure the sound financial footing necessary to achieve their goals.

## DEDICATED TO SUCCESS
We build empathy with our clients and their business environment. Our experience in starting and building businesses, especially in the post-Asian Financial Crisis era, is first hand. 

TLC has a clear affinity for, and deep understanding of, the challenges facing growing businesses in today's Asia. In building a business, we take the long term perspective. Whilst all stakeholder interests need to be aligned strategically and structurally, we also address the important and key cultural issues. 

Our people have a track record in facilitating investor access to business opportunities in Europe and Asia; specifically the markets of Greater China, ASEAN and North Asia. 

We believe that simplicity of execution is a virtue. Maintaining and enhancing our reputation is fundamental to TLC's business philosophy. With a corporate mantra of ***"tell it as it is"***, we are proud to deliver with passion and quality.
