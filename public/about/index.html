<h2 id="gateway-to-asia">GATEWAY TO ASIA</h2>

<p>Tang Long Consulting is an independent advisory firm that addresses the demand for specialist strategy consulting from mid-market companies across Asia. Committed to the region, TLC looks to transform businesses and empower management teams to achieve their vision.</p>

<h2 id="localised-experience">LOCALISED EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>TLC&rsquo;s Principals established a highly successful structured finance operation in Hong Kong in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis. Through practical experience, we understand the challenges of growing a business under difficult market conditions and place strong emphasis on ensuring that our clients secure the sound financial footing necessary to achieve their goals.</p>

<h2 id="dedicated-to-success">DEDICATED TO SUCCESS</h2>

<p>We build empathy with our clients and their business environment. Our experience in starting and building businesses, especially in the post-Asian Financial Crisis era, is first hand.</p>

<p>TLC has an affinity for, and understanding of, the challenges facing growing businesses in today&rsquo;s Asia. In building a business, we take the long term perspective. Whilst all stakeholder interests need to be aligned strategically and structurally, we also address the important and key cultural issues.</p>

<p>Our people have a track record in facilitating investor access to business opportunities in Europe and Asia; specifically the markets of Greater China, ASEAN and North Asia.</p>

<p>We believe that simplicity of execution is a virtue. Maintaining and enhancing our reputation is fundamental to TLC&rsquo;s business philosophy. With a corporate mantra of &ldquo;tell it as it is&rdquo; is, we are proud to deliver with passion and quality.</p>
